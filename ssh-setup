Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent
Before adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys, you should have checked for existing SSH keys and generated a new SSH key. When adding your SSH key to the agent, use the default macOS ssh-add command, and not an application installed by macports, homebrew, or some other external source.

Start the ssh-agent in the background.

$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
> Agent pid 59566
If you're using macOS Sierra 10.12.2 or later, you will need to modify your ~/.ssh/config file to automatically load keys into the ssh-agent and store passphrases in your keychain.

First, check to see if your ~/.ssh/config file exists in the default location.

$ open ~/.ssh/config
> The file /Users/you/.ssh/config does not exist.
If the file doesn't exist, create the file.

$ touch ~/.ssh/config
Open your ~/.ssh/config file, then modify the file, replacing ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 if you are not using the default location and name for your id_ed25519 key.

Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Note: If you chose not to add a passphrase to your key, you should omit the UseKeychain line.

Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent and store your passphrase in the keychain. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_ed25519 in the command with the name of your private key file.

$ ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard.

If your SSH public key file has a different name than the example code, modify the filename to match your current setup. When copying your key, don't add any newlines or whitespace.

$ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copies the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file to your clipboard
